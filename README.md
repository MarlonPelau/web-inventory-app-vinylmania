My "vinylmania" web inventory app project aims to target those avid record collectors, searching for a qaulity sound in their music, beyond the seamlessly, easier (but lower quality) lo-fi sound of various streaming platforms. This app aims to connect the consumer with rare, limited edition vinyl releases, as well as some of their favorite classic albums, recently reissued on vinyl and now available in an even better sound quality than previous formats. Dust off the record player, clean up those old needles, it's time to play and give your ears the vinylmania treatment!

-Instructions for installation (fork and clone): 
```git clone https://marlonpelau.github.io/web-inventory-app-vinylmania/``` 
```cd web-inventory-app-vinylmania```
```??```

-In this app, the user can search availability, to find their vinyl needs. They can also be specific in their entry, by filling out the form box below published releases, by entering the 'title' or name of the album/release, the 'artist', the 'price', the 'release year' and also if it's 'in-stock' to purchase. Subsequently, by clicking the 'release year', one can read a brief background on the particular LP, the era and overall vibe of the artist to delve into what made it such a classic.

-Some stretch goals include the 'search' option link at top, which is disguised up top as you enter the app, with an even more relevant direct message 'dig in our crates' for those vinyl aficianados. Maybe some CSS effects might be implemented? Hey, you'll just have to visit and see haa!

-Right now, for obvious reasons, I chose my host/base as 'turntablelab' for vinyl database purposes based on this app being a demo and obvious amateur class project. This site can be found here: https://www.turntablelab.com/
