My "vinylmania" web inventory app project aims to target those avid record collectors, searching for a qaulity sound in their music, beyond the seamlessly, easier (but lower quality) lo-fi sound of various streaming platforms. This app aims to connect the consumer with rare, limited edition vinyl releases, as well as some of their favorite classic albums. Recently reissued on vinyl and now available in an even better sound quality than previous formats, dust off the record player, it's time to give your ears the "vinylmania" treatment!

-Instructions for installation (fork and clone): type 'git clone'+paste the URL you copied from the repository, then hit enter (see below).
```git clone https://marlonpelau.github.io/web-inventory-app-vinylmania/``` 
access the files and more by CD-ing into the below by typing...
```cd web-inventory-app-vinylmania```


-In this app, the user can search availability by filling out the form box below published releases, by entering the 'title' or name of the album/release, the 'artist', the 'price', the 'release year' and also if it's 'in-stock' to purchase. Subsequently, by clicking the 'release year', one can briefly read about the era, overall vibe of the artist, and their background, to delve further into what made it such a classic.

-Some stretch goals for those vinyl aficianados? Sure, the CSS effect 'hover' method is utilized on ALL buttons; default values in the form of image placeholders are un there; and my 'footer' sticks to the bottom of the browser window, thank you!

-Right now, for obvious reasons, I chose my host/base as 'turntablelab' for my actual vinyl databa since this app is a demo, limited and obviously an amateur class project. The site can be found here:
